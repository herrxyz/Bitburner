# Bitburner

Scripts for Bitburner.


I'm using scripts from https://github.com/alainbryden/bitburner-scripts , but added some manually started scripts

| script name | explanation | SF4 required |
| ---- | ---- | --- |
| achievement-unclickable.js | get achievement "unclickable" | no |
| find_best_infiltration_target.js | autoselects & runs infilitration.js, selects a joined faction where rep is missing, if no augs available it selects money | yes |
| find_most_efficient_infiltration_target.js | 	creates a list with all infilitration targets and their money / rep gains, just for information | yes |
| find_path_to_server.js | shows a path to a specific server and prints the route, copyable to directly connect | no |
| infiltration.js | solves (mostly) all minigames for infiltration and can automatically select reward and do it again | no |
| shopping.js |	after manually buying TOR Browser, this script allows to buy Programs even before SF4 | no |
| work_for_factions.js | pdated version of work for faction, still a little buggy because it does focus on jobs which it should'nt | no |
